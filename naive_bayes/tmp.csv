473,"is the finest, least compromised film about capital punishment ever advancing a gently stated 'anti' view but going the extra 100 miles to give victims their due."
2546,"Given American cinema's current obsession with innocence and ignorance, at least this never romanticises its protagonists. They are genuinely, irredeemably, 100 per cent no-hopers."
5743,"It's Cameron's show; he's the reigning king of movie pow, with dark wit and a poet's eye for mayhem. T2 cost a reported $100 million, and you can actually see where the money went."
6495,"Face/Off is a full-blooded, movie-going experience. It's 100 percent movie."
11590,"A vigorous, four-hour adaptation that's 100 percent Shakespeare and 100 percent cinema."
11843,A $100 million piece of piffle.
12642,"A lot of money was spent on this film, but $100 million doesn't guarantee a good product. Maybe someone should have thought of spending a few more dollars on a better script."
16410,Considering the recent screen standards in book musicals with five numbers for 100 to 110 minutes of running time this Metro Santaclausing of numbers becomes virtually a double-feature filmusical.
18999,"The movie... fails by the standards of $100 million Hollywood star action vehicles, and by the standards of World War II Oscar-bait epics. But by the standards of anticipated career-crushing trainwrecks, it's pretty good."
21680,Lives up to its title -- spend 100-plus minutes with this lacklustre thing and you definitely feel snookered.
22688,Whoever thought of having evil's final manifestation take the form of a 100-ft. marshmallow deserves the rational mind's eternal gratitude.
23495,"With a budget said to be more than $100 million, it displays a lot of cash on the screen, but little thought."
23510,An exhilarating 100 minutes!
23825,For the first 100 minutes or so I found this hokey but serviceable; after that my watch became more meaningful than anything I could locate on-screen.
25379,"Loaded with a wealth of songs, it's meaty, not too kaleidoscopic and yet closely knit for a compact 100 minutes of tiptop filmusical entertainment."
25764,"For about 100 of its 108 minutes, this film treats the viewer to a stylish, suspenseful roller coaster peppered with all manner of ugly, money-grubbing corporate types."
